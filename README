How to get started
==================

Install
-------

$ virtualenv ENV
$ . ENV/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Starting the system
-------------------

The commands below are expected to be run in the SCI directory. Almost all of them
also expect that you have run ''. ENV/bin/activate'' first. They should be run
in a terminal window of its own (or a GNU screen window).

$ redis-server redis.conf
$ ./ss.py
$ ./jobserver.py
$ ./backend.py
$ ./start_slaves.sh 6

Running the sample
------------------

The sample is a matrix job which builds Android. If you don't want to build an entire
Android system every time, we can use a mocked version of the important parts of
Android's build system.

$ wget https://github.com/downloads/boivie/sci/mock-android-repo.zip
$ unzip mock-android-repo.zip 
$ git daemon --export-all --base-path=mock-android-repo --detach

Now we have a running GIT server offering a mock Android source repository. Let
us now run the sample:

$ cd samples
$ ./build-android.py BRANCH=donut-dev

Running the Web Frontend
------------------------

You can also start a web frontend that allows you to manage jobs, builds and more.

$ ./sciweb.py
