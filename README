Environment Variables
---------------------

This information can be provided to a slave:

 - SCI_MASTER_URL: The url to the master, if any.
 - SCI_SERVER_ID: A short server identifier.
   if this is not provided (which would mean running in a debug environment),
   a random server ID is generated.
 - SCI_JOB_KEY: The job key, which it will use with all communication to the
   master. In a debug environment, there is no master, so it's unused.
 - SCI_CONFIG: Path to the global configuration file. It will be loaded
   by the job prior to executing it.
