Environment Variables
---------------------

This information can be provided to a slave:

 - SCI_MASTER_URL: The url to the master, if any.
 - SCI_SERVER_ID: A short server identifier.
   if this is not provided (which would mean running in a debug environment),
   a random server ID is generated.
 - SCI_JOB_KEY: The job key, which it will use with all communication to the
   master. In a debug environment, there is no master, so it's unused.
 - SCI_CONFIG: Path to the global configuration file. It will be loaded
   by the job prior to executing it.


Job Types
---------

Main Job
~~~~~~~~

This is the job that is started by an external action (most often by the user).

- A job's main function will be the entry point.
- The user provides it with a list of parameters. Some may not be given and
  the default value will be used. Required parameters will have to be set.
- A configuration file may be loaded, if one is specified.
- An environment will be created with some default values.

Sub-Job
~~~~~~~

A 'main job' may trigger sub-jobs that can run on other machines. They are
always started by a main job and their entry point will be a step inside
the recipe.

- A job's step (as specified by the main job) will be the entry point.
- The environment, parameters and configuration files from the main job
  will be used.

The sub-job always belongs to a main job.
